# MESA-Site

*This project requires basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and minor amounts of Javascript. Resources that might help include The Odin Project (FreeCodeCamp version to bypass installing Linux) and reading documentation (I KNOWWWW 😭), and Google is your friend.*

*Note: This website requires JQuery to be installed and configured with the IDE being used. This enables the script for the connected headers/footers on each page.

This is the source code for rebuilding the Chabot MESA/TRiO-STEM Website.

So far, the Index and Apply pages are completed, with templates for the Study Hall, Mentorship, and Events pages. The headers and footers for each page are connected to header.html and footer.html respectively.

There are backups of each page in the ./backups folder.

For updating pictures and flyers: best format is .png for highest quality and best scalability. Label each image clearly, and add it to the respective folder.

Every section is created by boxes (most are flexboxes), with settings controlled in styles.css. Be cautious of which boxes are connected by larger containers, and how effects to larger containers can trickle down. Each image should be inside individual boxes within a larger container.

Please please please, feel free to optimize. This was my first attempt at a website, so there are definitely ways to clean up the code that I didn't have time to figure out. For example, the boxes can likely be condensed, as well as some better categorization.

Remember: if you get stuck, other people have undoubtedly run into similar issues. So don't be afraid to ask around or look up different solutions.

Best of luck, and happy coding!
